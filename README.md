# Digiturk.Intern.ToDoList2.WebApp
This is my very first project for my internship in the Web Development Apartment.
Though the list is missing a checkbox, still rocks with a cyberpunk-like theme.
Displays a test input for a start to give an idea about the design of the list.
User input can be added, updated and deleted.
Hope it gives a complimentary experience ✨✨
